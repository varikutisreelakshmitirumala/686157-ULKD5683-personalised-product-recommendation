# Dataset
I have used an amazon dataset on user ratings for electronic products, this dataset doesn't have any headers. To avoid biases, each product and user is assigned a unique identifier instead of using their name or any other potentially biased information.
You can find the dataset here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vibivij/amazon-electronics-rating-datasetrecommendation/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
